Here is a test to help you practice doing basic functions using a csv file. The answer code can be found in grades.py (which uses grades.csv for input). Sample output is written to grades_output.txt


You have a csv file storing student grades. The first two homeworks are scored on a scale of 10. The third homework was Pass/Fail, The two tests are out of 100. The sample file below is an example of how the data will be formatted.


grades.csv
last name, first name, HW1, HW2, HW3, Test1, Test2
Sprat, Jack, 10, 9, P, 100, 75
Blunt, Emily, 10, 10, P, 100, 99
Farrow, Ronan, 8, 8, P, 92, 97
Sheen, Charlie, 5, 2, F, 75, 67






1. Write code to read the file using only the csv module (the regular csv reader), print each line, and print the class average for hw1, hw2, test1, and test2.
2. Write the same code using DictReader.
3. Write the same code using namedTuple
4. Write code that will read the file and display a class grade summary for each student. The results should be ordered by student last name, and show the student’s average hw grade and student’s avg test grade


        Blunt, Emily, 10, 99.9
        Farror, Ronan, 8, 93.8
        Sheen, Charlie
        Sprat, Jack


5. Write code to determine which student has the highest cumulative grade. Cumulative grade is calculated as 70% of the test avg grade and 30% of the homework avg grade
6. Write code to get the top 3 students with the highest cumulative grade.
